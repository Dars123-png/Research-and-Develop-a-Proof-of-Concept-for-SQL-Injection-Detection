#  SQL Injection Detection Tool (PoC)

A Python-based tool for detecting **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerabilities in web applications.  
It supports detection of:

-  Classic SQL Injection (Error-based)
-  Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection
-  Time-Based Blind SQL Injection  
-  Generates a detailed PDF report (with graphs and CVE mapping)

-  Identifies error-based, blind, and time-based SQL injection
-  PDF report includes:
  - Scan results
  - Exploited parameters
  - Payloads used
  - Detection logic
  - Real-world CVEs (2022â€“2024)
  - Prevention recommendations
-  Export results as pie charts and vulnerability tables
